There are some methods, array methods that you can't run on a NodeList so you would need to transform it into an array <br/>
For each we can run it on our NodeList

Questions while coding 🤔
1. Why I can't use styles.includes() instead of styles.contains() ??? <br/>
-The contains method returns a boolean value, true if the class is present, and false otherwise. <br/>
-On the other hand, the includes method is not a method of DOMTokenList. It is a method of arrays in JavaScript. So, if you try to use styles.includes(), you will likely get an error because includes is not a method of DOMTokenList.

Normally you would get this type of data using AJAX requests, so it would be somewhere else. And then you would just perform a HTTP request. <br/>
But in this case we are using data locally, it's just an array of objects. Each object represents a different person, with different name, job, img and text.
